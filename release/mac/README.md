   * `run_encoding_manager_mac_a.sh` ‚á® `search_in_timelines_and_encode_GUI_mac_a.py`
   * `run_encoding_manager_mac_b.sh` ‚á® `search_in_timelines_and_encode_GUI_mac_b.py`

2. **Make the Shell Scripts Executable**
   Open a Terminal in the folder where the files are located and run:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_encoding_manager_mac_a.sh
   chmod +x run_encoding_manager_mac_b.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   In the same Terminal window, launch one of the GUIs by running:

   ```bash
   ./run_encoding_manager_mac_a.sh
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ./run_encoding_manager_mac_b.sh
   ```

   This will start the corresponding Python-based GUI interface using the DaVinci Resolve scripting API.
